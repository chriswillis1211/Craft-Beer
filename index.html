    <h1>All About Craft Beer</h1>

    <p>
      For all of us at BrewDog, craft beer is more than something to be enjoyed
      on a Friday night when the week has come to an end. It is a way of life.
      If you had to distil this point into a single word, it would be passion.
      The enthusiasm for being involved in this industry, and for delivering the
      greatest levels of service and beer quality is inherent in everything that
      we do, each and every day of the week. Including Friday nights. And that
      wonâ€™t ever change.
